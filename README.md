# Csharp-OutCompressedDLL
All I did was build a version of Powersploits Out-CompressedDLL C# Csharp OutCompresseedDLL. I needed to convert a dll to base64 in c# and not powershell. 

Original Author are the creators of Powersploit.
I kept all the original Powershell code as comments for your review.
