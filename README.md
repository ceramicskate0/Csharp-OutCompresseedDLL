# Csharp-OutCompressedDLL
All I did was build a version of Powersploits Out-CompressedDLL C# Csharp OutCompresseedDLL. I needed to convert a bin to base64 in c# and not powershell. 

Original Author are the creators of Powersploit.
I kept all the original Powershell code as comments for your review.

This C# code will only output the base64 of the input file. It does not load or execute it. See https://github.com/ceramicskate0/SafetyKatz/tree/master/SafetyKatz for 1 way on how to do that.
